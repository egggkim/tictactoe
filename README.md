Project one, demo day Monday, December 15, 2014. 

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* Render a game board in the browser
* Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
* Declare a winner if a player gets three in a row, cat's game if neither does
* Allow for two players to compete on separate devices

## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
These are for extra credit! Don't focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

* Display a "waiting..." message while users are waiting to be matched
* Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
* Allow players to choose a name or icon instead of "Player 1" or X/O
* Get inventive with your styling -- use hover effects or animations to spiff things up
* Add "tableside" chat to your game
